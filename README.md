# ThaxtOS

ThaxtOS is an experimantal operating system built on the Linux kernel, but completely written from scratch in userspace.

So, no `libc`, no standard headers, no attempt at POSIX conformance.  Just a way to learn about userspace Linux from the ground up.

For the time being, it is targeted to the aarch64 (ARM64) architecture, but should be possible to extend to other architectures.
